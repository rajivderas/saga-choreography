# saga-choreography-pattern
<p>The saga design pattern is a way to manage data consistency across microservices in distributed transaction scenarios.</p>  

<p>A saga is a sequence of transactions that updates each service and publishes a message or event to trigger the next transaction step.</p>  
<p>This project is a demonstration of this pattern implemented using Spring and <b>Apache Kafka</b> which is an open-source distributed event streaming platform</p>
